Steps:
Step 1: Decode the description field from Base64 using UTF-8 to prevent character issues.
Step 2: Sanitize the decoded text to remove malicious content, strip unsafe tags/scripts, and unescape HTML.
Step 3: Save the cleaned payload to database table X with retries (1 min, 3 min, 3 min); notify the user via SMS, Call, or Email if all retries fail.
Step 4: Send the payload to Azure Service Bus Queue using SPN authentication, applying the same retry and notification logic.
Step 5: Respond to the UI with success if all steps pass, else return an error with notification details.
